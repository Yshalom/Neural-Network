<h1>Neural-Network</h1>
<h2>This is a simple project who uses C# and OpenTK-OpenCL (for GPU calculations).</h2>

<p>This program builds and uses in Neural-Network Algorithm to recognize number characters (0-9).


In this repository, there is a Zip folder.
This Zip folder was taken from Visual Studio and zipped, if you want to use this project, you can unzip the folder and open it by Visual Studio.

* This project uses OpenTK and .Net 6.0 </p>
